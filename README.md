# VulkanBoxes
My first foray into Vulkan.  What else are you gonna do during a pandemic?  

This contains code from the Vulkan Tutorial by Alexander Overvoorde, April 2020.

So...this changed to OpenGL 4.6.  It's morphed into a cubic voxel-based world. The Vulkan code is still there but there is a new OpenGL-based implementation.

It uses...

  ...[NVIDIA Physx](https://developer.nvidia.com/physx-sdk) for physics
  
  ...[GLM](https://github.com/g-truc/glm) for math
  
  ...[FreeType](https://www.freetype.org/) for rendering fonts
  
  ...[nothings/stb](https://github.com/nothings/stb) for reading/writing images
  
  ...and, [OpenGL](https://www.opengl.org/)...of course
